# The STL of Cleva
The STL, the Standard library should be modular and optional. This means that the compiler and the STL should be seperated as possible. 

The STL will be entirely written in Cleva itself. 

_More structs are ready to be added when needed. Suggestions always welcome!_

## Vector
A dynamically growable array.

Shall contain methods such as Sort, Binary Search

## Deque
A double ended queue.

## Iterators
The mother of all functional programming features that I like. Should be implemented as a Trait(as in Rust). And all STL containers should implement this trait.

## HashMap

## BinaryMap
