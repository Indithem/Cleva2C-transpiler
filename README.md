Just a child's dream of 
A programming language that is designed to be used sorely for Competeive programming contests. It gets transpiled to C, for now. For more information about the language, see the [docs](./docs/README.md).

# Getting started
This repository contains the source code for the transpiler of this language. To build the transpiler, you require the cargo package manager, which can be installed by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To build the transpiler, run the following command:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

To directly use the transpiler without building it, you can use the following command:
```bash
cargo run --release -- <args>
```
where args are the arguments that you would pass to the transpiler.
